Our tests are unique because we are checked the total number of rooms and checked an alternating
amount of rooms in our testRoomLabels function. In our comments we mentioned which rooms the doors
should lead to.

In our fourDoor Directions test we tested 4 doorways to see if they have different directions.
We also checked room cells, unused areas, and walkways to make sure they are not doors.
In testRooms we checked a room not on the edge of the board, we checked a room on the edge with
a weird shape, and we checked a room on the corner of the board to check if labels and center are correct.

We added a testInitial method to check if a cell's initial matched to room it was located in.
For walkways, doors, and unused we assert that roomcenter and room label is false.
